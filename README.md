## About

AWS S3 Website Creater is a Python script using Boto3 to host a static website using the amazing feature that AWS provides. This process is very easy to do if the user just wants to use the GUI to create it. However, to create the websites programmatically this turned out to be significantly harder. During MLH Prime Southwest Regional 2016, we needed a way to create website dynamically with unique names using AWS. This came to be the AWS S3 Website Creater.

## Functionality
- Create AWS Websites with specific bucket names
- Upload any to all files to the S3 Bucket
- Set bucket policies
- Set each file to have unique policies

## Installation

To get started following the instructions:
- Install boto 3 - pip install boto3
- Run the script aws_s3.py

## Libraries Used

- Boto3
